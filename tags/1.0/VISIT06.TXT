   You approach the castle of Macduff.  You
are accepted here.
   Lady Macduff greets you, "Hail, Thane
of the Highlands.  Lord Macduff is not here.
He resides at the castle of Lord Malcolm at
the time being.  You are welcome to stay
here if you wish."
   You stay for almost a week and establish
good relations with the House of Macduff.
