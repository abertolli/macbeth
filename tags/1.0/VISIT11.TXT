   You travel along the road that leads to
Dunsinane.  Suddenly, everyone who is with
you disappears and all you see are three
whithered old crones.
   "Beware."  they say.  "Beware Macbeth.
His hospitality is that of a smiling serpent.
The blood on his hands can never be washed
clean.  Beware Macbeth."
   And then they mysteriously disappear,
and you are back on the road to Dunsinane.
