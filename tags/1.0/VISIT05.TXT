   You have arrived at the castle of King
Macbeth.  Macbeth himself greets you and
readily takes you in.
   "We are very glad you came." relates
Macbeth, "It is always good to know my
faithful servants."
   That night there is a feast in your
honor.  You eat well, and are given a
comfortable bed.  You fall asleep ...







 ... a sleep from which you never awaken.
