   You are stopped by guards at the gate
to the castle.  They question you and hold
you out for a while.  Once they find out
who you are, they tell you that Malcolm is
no longer alive and that there sits a new
ruler.
   You demand entrance to see the new ruler,
but you are refused.  You realize tensions
are rising around here due to your presence,
and wisely decide to go back home.
