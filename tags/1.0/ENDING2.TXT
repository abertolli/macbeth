   Today is a day of joy mixed with
sorrow.  It is the day of Scotland's
liberation from the tyrant Macbeth.
However, the people of Scotland feel the
weight upon their hearts brought about by
the tragic death of the noble Lord Malcolm.
May his soul rest in peace.
   As for Scotland, you are happy to see
the day of freedom.  You have been waiting
for this day ever since the death of King
Duncan III.  You await to see the next
High King of Scotland.
