   You approach the castle of Macduff.  The
place is quiet, and your summons goes
unanswered.
   A simple peasant of the nearby village
approaches and bows clumsily, "I regret to
inform you, mi lord, but Master Macduff is
no longer with us."
   You demand to know what has happened
and the peasant answers, "Many soldiers
came.  They went through and attacked our
village, but they were here mostly to raze
the House of Macduff.  It fills my heart
with sorrow--Macduff was a kind and noble
ruler.  I know not who they were.  No one
lives in this manor now."
   Unpleased by the results of this trip,
you point your horse towards your castle for
the return home.
