~aid1
   The messenger seems to be trying to suppress his laughter
and hide it from you.  You demand to know what it is.
   "But, mi lord," responds the messenger, "Is it wise to ask
aid from a dead man?"
   Oh, now you remember.  You're too embarrassed to punish
the messenger.
~

~aid2
   You need aid.  If only you could get it.  You just don't
have the money to properly request aid.  For right now, you
need to think of something else.
~

~aid3
   You send out a request for military aid.  And, amazingly,
you are sent additional soldiers and equipment.
~

~aid4
   It seems that you are not well liked.  They flatly and
rudely refuse your request for help.
~

~aid5
   You request military aid, but your not sure message even
got through because no aid ever comes.  You are left to fight
your own battles once again.
~

~ally1
   At first you prepare for an alliance, but then, after
thinking it over, you decide that it's just impossible to
deal with dead people.
~

~ally2
   You must, of course, understand that such a venture is
going to cost some quality time and money.  You may have the
time, but you certainly don't have the money.
~

~ally3
   You have done much work to organize an alliance and your
efforts have not gone unrewarded.  You have built much better
diplomatic relationships and have boosted the morale of your
people.
~

~ally4
   The alliance talks are lengthy and much debated.
Unfortunately, they do not go as well as they could, and
there will be no alliance.
~

~army1
... the attack is successfull!!!
Army against army--man against his brother.  The battle is
won out on the field.
~

~army2
... the attack is a loss.
The defending forces are victorious.  The battle has been
lost.
~

~assassin1
and, he is successful.  The assassination is clean and no one
suspects you.
~

~attack1
and, he is successful.  The assassination is clean and no one
suspects you.
~

~attack2
   You just finish writing up an order to move troops when
you remember that he isn't alive any more!  You quickly burn
the order.
~

~attack3
   Face it:  it's hard enough to find someone to do the job,
but impossible to find someone to do it for free!
~

~attack4
   It's an interesting plan.  No, a rather amazing plan.
There's just one problem:  he's already dead!
~

~band1
... the attack is successfull.
The battle is brief and the attackers arise victorious.
~

~band2
... the attack is a loss.
The defending forces are victorious.  The attacking band of
men is no more.
~

~caught1
Your assassin has been caught and has been killed.  The other
leaders view you with their most loathing disgust.
~

~gifts1
   You're sure that the gifts would be most appreciated, but
he simply is not alive anymore.  You wonder if he knows about
or appreciates the thought wherever he is right now.
~

~gifts2
   It is very kind of you to try and give gifts when you have
so little money.  In fact you can't afford the gifts.
They'll just have to wait until later.
~

~gifts3
   You messenger accomplished her mission.  The gifts are
accepted and you recieve a message describing the pleasing
reception of them.  You have established some good diplomatic
relations.  The people also seem pleased with this.
~

~gifts4
   A bit after sending the gifts (properly guarded of
course), the messenger and a couple of guards return.  One of
the bloodied guards explains, "Forgive us.  We were surprised
by bandits.  There were too many.  They took the treasures
and killed some of my peers."  He hangs his head in dishonor.
~

~gifts5
   You send a messenger with your gifts along with guards to
protect it.
   Unfortunately, you never hear anything about it again.
Oh, if you ever get your hands on that messenger ...
~

~goodrule1
   A representative of the people of the Highlands requests
to see you.  Being the good ruler that you are, you accept.
   A man approaches, "On behalf of your loyal servants, I
present you with these gifts.  We are grateful for your kind
and generous rulership."  You recieve 20 pounds worth of
gifts.
~

~holiday1
   Good idea.  Unfortunately, you can't because you don't
have the funds.  Try something else.
~

~holiday2
declares a holiday.  The people gladly accept they're time
off.  Rumors of their lord's kindness spread.
~

~knight1
... the attack is successfull!
The battle is gloriously fought by the two noble factions.
The attacking knight returns home with loot from the battle.
~

~knight2
... the attack is a loss.
The defending forces are victorious.  The attacking forces
flee and the knight has been slain.
~

~macbeth1
   Malcolm executes a direct assult upon Macbeth's castle ...

And is triumphant!
Malcolm's armies have defeated the tyrant.
~

~macbeth1
   The people of Scotland have risen. They have taken Macbeth
off the throne themselves.  It is the people who choose not
to be governed by the fiend anymore.
~

~macduff1
   You hear the news of the fall of the House of Macduff.
Rumors have it that King Macbeth secretly hired a band of
mercenaries that destroyed the domain of Macduff.
~

~macduff2
   The most peculiar rumor has just struck your ears.  It
seems that Macduff's own people have removed him as their
lord.  You don't know the details, but you do know that
Macduff was the best and most kind lord you have ever known.
~

~malcolm1
   Hope of ridding the land of the tyrant Macbeth has turned
into dispair.  Macbeth has defeated Malcolm at his own castle
and has a placed a new lord in Malcolm's place.
~

~malcolm2
   The people in Malcolm's domain have decided upon a new
lord.  Malcolm was not easily convinced, but he was wise
enough not to resist.  You don't know what has happened to
Malcolm.
~

~peace1
   Sorry but this guy has already got all the peace he wants.
In fact, he rests in peace.
~

~peace2
   Unfortunately, the costs of this noble venture on your own
part are too much for you to handle.  You'd better think of
something else.
~

~peace3
   You send a messenger.  You are starting to wonder if the
message ever went through when another message returns.  The
request for peace has been accepted.
~

~peace4
   You send a messenger with a request for peace.  You never
get a response.  You will never what happened to that
messenger or the message.
~

~peace5
   You choose your finest, swiftest carrier to deliver the
message personally.  Later his body is found in Birnam Wood,
having been tortured and mangled in a most peculiar fashion.
~

~peace6
   You message is sent immediately.  Soon you recieve word
that your request for peace has been politely rejected.
~

~spy1
   "Let me save you some money." says your so-called spy.
"The man you want information on is dead."  And with that, he
runs, laughing maniacally, out the door and down the hall.
(Obviously one of the notorious roving jesters in disguise.)
~

~spy2
   "Hey," exclaims the spy, "what is this?  I don't work for
free you kno--"
   Not needing to hear the rest, you quickly lop off his head
with your sword and order some servants to clean up the mess.
~

~spy3
   You henchman is successful.  You recieve information ...
~

~spy4
   One day you hear the gruesome details about your
unsuccessful spy.  He has been captured and tortured til
death.  You wonder what he has said.
~

~taxes1
collects 200 pounds worth of taxes.  The people are not happy
with this and vocally portray thier disgust.
~

~threat1
   Hmmm...  Threatening dead people?  I'm not sure if you
should be embarrassed or ashamed.
~

~threat2
   If you haven't noticed, you're in dire economic straits.
(You haven't got a pound to your name.)
~

~threat3
   You threat has been recieved.  You are a formidable foe,
and your threat has been taken seriously.  Now you have one
less messenger to worry about.  Maybe it wasn't such a good
idea.
~

~threat4
   You send a threatening message.  You recieve a message in
return to the effect, "Is this a joke?!"  The threat is
ridiculed and dismissed as a minor trifle at most.
~

~threat5
   You get word that your messenger has fallen prey to
Ronald's Roving Jesters, an activist group for the rights of
bards.  He's probably been killed or driven insane.
~

~visit1
   You pack everything up and are just about to leave when
you notice you do not have the funds for the trip.  You have
to stay at home for right now.
~

~visit2
   You encounter a band of roving jesters.  Unfortunately,
they decide to follow.  They are able to evade your guards
and continue to torment you.  Once the castle is within
sight, they run off.
~

~visit3
   You travel through pleasant woods. Suddenly, you fall prey
to criminal mercenaries.  The battle is brief and your
experienced men easily defeat the outlaws.
~

~visit4
   You pass through the woods.  The forest grows dark and you
are met by scores of renegade mercenaries.  The outlaws slay
your men in a lengthy battle.  You barely escape with your
life.  The brigands have made off with some of your
treasures.  You start walking back to your castle...
~

~visit5
   You have arrived at the castle of King Macbeth.  Macbeth
himself greets you and readily takes you in.
   "We are very glad you came." relates Macbeth, "It is
always good to know my faithful servants."
   That night there is a feast in your honor.  You eat well,
and are given a comfortable bed.  You fall asleep ...




 ... a sleep from which you never awaken.
~

~visit6
   You approach the castle of Macduff.  You are accepted
here.
   Lady Macduff greets you, "Hail, Thane of the Highlands.
Lord Macduff is not here.  He resides at the castle of Lord
Malcolm at the time being.  You are welcome to stay here if
you wish."
   You stay for almost a week and establish good relations
with the House of Macduff.
~

~visit7
   You are stopped by guards at the gate to the castle.  They
question you and hold you out for a while.  But they
eventually get a message to allow you passage and you enter
the castle of Lord Malcolm.
   On your way to see Malcolm you find Lord Macduff, "I am
pleased to see you got our message.  You must talk to
Malcolm, for matters are heavy."
   When you finally get to see Malcolm, you are able to
present him with the small trinkets you have brought and
establish better relations with him.
   You stay for a week.  When you depart, Malcolm gives
you some equipment for your armies.
~

~visit8
   You are stopped by guards at the gate to the castle.  They
question you and hold you out for a while.  They eventually
get a message and refuse to allow you passage to the castle
of Lord Malcolm.
   Angrily, you turn and proceed to return to your own
castle.
~

~visit9
   You approach the castle of Macduff.  The place is quiet,
and your summons goes unanswered.
   A simple peasant of the nearby village approaches and bows
clumsily, "I regret to inform you, mi lord, but Master
Macduff is no longer with us."
   You demand to know what has happened and the peasant
answers, "Many soldiers came.  They went through and attacked
our village, but they were here mostly to raze the House of
Macduff.  It fills my heart with sorrow--Macduff was a kind
and noble ruler.  I know not who they were.  No one lives in
this manor now."
   Unpleased by the results of this trip, you point your
horse towards your castle for the return home.
~

~visit10
   You are stopped by guards at the gate to the castle.  They
question you and hold you out for a while.  Once they find
out who you are, they tell you that Malcolm is no longer
alive and that there sits a new ruler.
   You demand entrance to see the new ruler, but you are
refused.  You realize tensions are rising around here due to
your presence, and wisely decide to go back home.
~

~visit11
   You travel along the road that leads to Dunsinane.
Suddenly, everyone who is with you disappears and all you see
are three whithered old crones.
   "Beware."  they say.  "Beware Macbeth.  His hospitality is
that of a smiling serpent.  The blood on his hands can never
be washed clean.  Beware Macbeth."
   And then they mysteriously disappear, and you are back on
the road to Dunsinane.
~

~overthrow1
   You hear a noise outside your window. You look.  The
peasants are rioting.  They have had enough of your poor
rulership.
   You dispatch soldiers to subdue them, but the people will
not take this abuse anymore.  Through sheer numbers, the
peasants break in and take over.  You are thrown out on your
face and the time for a new Thane of the Highlands has come.
~

~conquered1
   Your armies have been depleted.  In a matter of a few
days, you hear the dreadful sound of the war drums.
   Macbeth's armies have conquered the Highlands, and the
threat of the Thane of the Highlands no longer troubles the
crown.
~

~ending1
   What a glorious day it is for the people of Scotland!
King Macbeth is dead, long live King Malcolm.
   The tyrant and fiend has been destroyed and the blood from
his hands razed from the slate of Scotland.  Malcolm gives an 
uplifting speech for the people and you are there to witness
it.



   Malcolm finishes, "So thanks to all at once, and to each
one, whom we invite to see us crowned at scone."
                                   - William Shakespeare
~

~ending2
   Today is a day of joy mixed with sorrow.  It is the day of
Scotland's liberation from the tyrant Macbeth.  However, the
people of Scotland feel the weight upon their hearts brought
about by the tragic death of the noble Lord Malcolm. May his
soul rest in peace.
   As for Scotland, you are happy to see the day of freedom.
You have been waiting for this day ever since the death of
King Duncan III.  You await to see the next High King of
Scotland.

~intro
It is the year 1031.  Macbeth has succeeded his father,
Finlay, as moarmaer (provincial governor) of Moray...

Later...
   It is the year 1040.  You have recently become Thane of
the Highlands under King Duncan I.
   A messenger enters, "I have terrible news, mi lord."  The
messenger pulls out a scroll with the seal of Macduff upon
it.  He reads, "Macbeth hath slain our noble King Duncan in
battle near Elgin.  He makes a direct claim to the crown by
his marriage to the granddaughter of King Kenneth III.  You
hereby are urged to aid us in cleansing Scotland of this
murderous tyrant."

   As Thane of the Highlands you realize the neccessity for
your involvement.  If you do not choose a side, you will
surely be taken after the conflict.  The High King of
Scotland is Macbeth, but you fear his rule may be at an end.

The choice is up to you...

Knight

   In medieval Europe the term knight referred to a mounted warrior of
secondary noble rank.  The medieval rank probably originated with the
barbarian tribes of northern Europe. Often the younger son of a
hereditary peer, the knight began his training as a young boy by
entering the service of an overlord.  At age 15 or 16 he was raised to
the rank of squire and began his period of trial.  When his overlord
considered him worthy, the prospective knight recieved his accolade,
traditionally a tap on the shoulder with a sword, which proclaimed him
a knight.  Once knighted he was entitled to the honorific title "Sir"
and continued in the military service of his overlord.
   As feudalism developed, the rank of knight became a landholding
rank.  The knight held his land by what was known as military tenure.
That is, in return for a land grant the knight was expected to render
military service to his overlord.  Knighthood also took on a religious
significance, and a vigil before the altar became part of the military
initiation into knighthood.

Medieval Drama

   The distinguishing characteristics of medieval drama are its
Christian elements and its didactic purpose.  Vernacular plays
typically dramatized the lives of the saints, stories from the Bible,
or moral allegories.
   The biblical cycle plays, sometimes called mystery plays, were
originally performed under church auspices.  Although they contained
Old Testament and nativity sequences, the cycles were primarily devoted
to portraying the life and passion of Christ, his harrowing of hell,
his resurrection and appearances to his disciples and the two Marys,
and his ascension.

Macbeth, King of Scotland

   The life of Macbeth, king of Scots, b. c.1005, d. Aug. 15, 1057,
formed the legendary basis of Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth.  He
succeeded (c.1031) his father, Finlay, as moarmaer (provincial
governor) of Moray.  Macbeth probably had a personal claim to the crown
of Scotland through royal descent, but he acquired an additional, more
direct, claim by his marriage to Gruoch, granddaughter of King Kenneth
III (r.997-1005).  Macbeth killed King Duncan I in battle near Elgin in
1040 and took the crown.  An attempt to dethrone Macbeth in favor of
Malcolm Canmore, the son of Duncan, was defeated in 1046.  In 1054,
however, Macbeth was forced to give Malcolm a southern part of
Scotland.  Malcolm defeated and killed Macbeth at the Battle of
Lumphanan in 1057 and the following year became king as Malcolm III.
Macbeth was buried at lona as a legitimate monarch.

Manorialism

   The great majority of the people lived in the country, where they
were divided into two main classes:  lords and villagers.  The lords
lived in manor houses, sometimes called castles, near which stood the
crofts of their villagers.  The villagers, who might legally be either
free or serf, cultivated the land--whether their own or their lord's.
The lord often had rights to services as well as monetary rents.  The
tenants commonly owed him a specified number of days of labor each
year.  He collected inheritence taxes and commanded his villagers' use
of his mill, oven, and winepress; above all, the  tenants were subject
to jurisdiction of his manorial court.
   The system of relationships between a lord and his tenants is called
manorialism.  Because manorial services were not always reliable, some
lords preferred to hire laborers from aamong the younger sons of the
villagers, and frequently villagers were able to commute their personal
services to a monetary payment.  Serfs, who were bound to the land,
might buy manumission, or if they fled to a town and lived there for a
year and a day, they were free of all manorial claims.  The example of
the towns encouraged some villagers to form rural communes and obtain
liberties of self-government from their lords; after the Black Death,
the scarcity of labor enabled the villagers to obtain greater personal
and economic freedom.
