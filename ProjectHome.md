It is the year 1031. Macbeth has succeeded his father, Finlay, as moarmaer (provincial governor) of Moray...

Later...

It is the year 1040. You have recently become Thane of the Highlands under King Duncan I.

A messenger enters, "I have terrible news, mi lord." The messenger pulls out a scroll with the seal of Macduff upon it. He reads, "Macbeth hath slain our noble King Duncan in battle near Elgin. He makes a direct claim to the crown by his marriage to the granddaughter of King Kenneth III. You hereby are urged to aid us in cleansing Scotland of this murderous tyrant."

As Thane of the Highlands you realize the neccessity for your involvement. If you do not choose a side, you will surely be taken after the conflict. The High King of Scotland is Macbeth, but you fear his rule may be at an end.

The choice is up to you...
