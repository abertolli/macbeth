   You hear a noise outside your window.
You look.  The peasants are rioting.  They
have had enough of your poor rulership.
   You dispatch soldiers to subdue them,
but the people will not take this abuse
anymore.  Through sheer numbers, the
peasants break in and take over.  You are
thrown out on your face and the time for
a new Thane of the Highlands has come.
