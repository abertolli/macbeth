   You are stopped by guards at the gate
to the castle.  They question you and hold
you out for a while.  But they eventually get
a message to allow you passage and you
enter the castle of Lord Malcolm.
   On your way to see Malcolm you find
Lord Macduff, "I am pleased to see you got
our message.  You must talk to Malcolm,
for matters are heavy."
   When you finally get to see Malcolm,
you are able to present him with the small
trinkets you have brought and establish better
relations with him.
   You stay for a week.  When you depart,
Malcolm gives you some equipment for your
armies.
