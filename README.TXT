   Hello.  Chances are you'll never see version 1.0 because the only other
people besides myself that have a copy of the first version are Mrs. Cusimano,
Mr. Concilio (my high school teachers), and Robert Carranza.  The big difference
between version 2.0 and version 1.0 is that version 1.0 used text files--a lot
of them--and version 2.0 uses .abc files.  ABC files are cryptic files that I
made using Turbo Pascal 6.0.  They're very easily broken, but they keep your
average person from changing things around.  Well, I hope you enjoy my English
project.

P.S.  You may call it vanity, but I'll tell you anyway.  ABC stands for Angelo
      Bertolli Cryptic.  (As if you cared.)
