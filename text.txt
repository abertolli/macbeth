ONE THOUSAND YEARS OF SOLITUDE
The Game
~

~intro
It is the year 1899.

The Thousand Days War has begun between the Conservative and 
Liberal parties. Among the most noteworthy generals is Colonel 
Aureliano Buendia, a strong-willed general, who is travelling 
with his band of loyal men from Macondo, fighting battles across
the country for the Liberal Party. His uncle, Don Apolinar Moscote,
after being driven out of Macondo by Aureliano, has taken up
residence nearby and plans to retake the city for the Conservative
Party. Meanwhile, Aureliano's impulsive brother, Arcadio, has taken
control of the city of the Macondo and rules it with an iron fist. 
You are Juan Neutraliano, the governor of a town near Macondo 
and it is your job to find a way for you and your town to survive 
the bloody conflict.
