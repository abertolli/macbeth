   A bit after sending the gifts (properly
guarded of course), the messenger and a
couple of guards return.
   One of the bloodied guards explains,
"Forgive us.  We were surprised by bandits.
There were too many.  They took the treasures
and killed some of my peers."  He hangs his
head in dishonor.
