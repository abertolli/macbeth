   What a glorious day it is for the
people of Scotland!  King Macbeth is dead,
long live King Malcolm.
   The tyrant and fiend has been destroyed
and the blood from his hands razed from the
slate of Scotland.  Malcolm gives an 
uplifting speech for the people and you are
there to witness it.





   Malcolm finishes, "So thanks to all at
once, and to each one, whom we invite to
see us crowned at scone."

                  - William Shakespeare
